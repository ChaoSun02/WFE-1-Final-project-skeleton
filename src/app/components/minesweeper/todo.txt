1 - disable right-click mouse options and make it to put a flag

2 - create a flag boolean (public) in cell-create.ts to check if the player has put a flag

3 - disable clicking when a player hits a bomb or wins the game (maybe from score)

4 - change the place where the score is, so it doesn't need to click again to see if the player has win. 

5 - put more gametables inside (maybe form a json) - later try to make it put the bombs in random and create a random gametable

6 - ? maybe put a timer
